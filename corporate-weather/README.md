# Corporate Weather

Corporate Weather is a DACH-focused Skybridge GPT app that analyzes visible public workplace risk signals. It is signal analysis only, not a prediction or legal advice.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+

### Local Development

#### 1. Install

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
# or
deno install
# or
yarn install
```

#### 2. Start your local server

Run the development server from this app directory:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
# or
deno task dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This command starts:
- Your MCP server at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.
- Skybridge DevTools UI at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Optional public search API

LinkedIn employee clusters are checked through public web-search snippets only when a search API key is configured. Without a key, the app labels LinkedIn as `not_configured` and treats that as missing evidence.

Supported providers:

```bash
# Brave Search API
SEARCH_API_PROVIDER=brave
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=...

# SerpApi
SEARCH_API_PROVIDER=serpapi
SERPAPI_API_KEY=...

# Tavily
SEARCH_API_PROVIDER=tavily
TAVILY_API_KEY=...
```

You can also use `SEARCH_API_KEY` with `SEARCH_API_PROVIDER`.

#### 3. Project structure

```
├── src/
│   ├── risk-model.ts     # DACH source strategy and scoring model
│   ├── server.ts         # MCP server entry point
│   └── helpers.ts        # Shared utilities
├── vite.config.ts
├── alpic.json            # Deployment config
└── package.json
```

### Create your first view

#### 1. Add a new view

- Register a tool in `src/server.ts` with a unique name (e.g., `my-view`) using [`registerTool`](https://docs.skybridge.tech/api-reference/register-tool) and a `view` config.
- Create a matching React component at `src/views/my-view.tsx`. **The file name must match the view name exactly**.

#### 2. Edit views with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Edit and save components in `src/views/` — changes will appear instantly inside your App.

#### 3. Edit server code

Modify files in `src/` and refresh the tool list with your MCP Client to see the changes.

### Testing your App

You can test your app locally by using our DevTools UI on `http://localhost:3000` while running the `dev` command.

To connect your app with web clients like ChatGPT or Claude, expose your server on the internet by adding the `--tunnel` flag.
By enabling the tunnel, you'll also be able to access a playground to chat with your app and a real LLM. Learn more by reading the [test guide](https://docs.skybridge.tech/quickstart/test-your-app).


## Deploy to Production

Skybridge is infrastructure vendor agnostic, and your app can be deployed on any cloud platform supporting MCP.

The simplest way to deploy your app is by running the `deploy` command, which will push your MCP server to the [Alpic](https://alpic.ai/) cloud for free.
